# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common rendering problem in React Native's FlatList component when dealing with large datasets. The issue leads to blank spaces appearing within the list, negatively impacting the user experience.  The solution implemented focuses on efficient key extraction and optimized rendering techniques. 

## Problem:

The `FlatList` component fails to render correctly when presented with a substantial amount of data. Instead of displaying all items, it shows gaps or blank spaces. 

## Solution:

The solution involves ensuring that each item in the `FlatList` has a unique and consistently extracted key using the `keyExtractor` prop.  This improves performance and data consistency during rendering.
